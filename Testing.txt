Our general testing strategy:
	We started off just slightly editing the original dump file so that we could know that the file still ran correctly after our edits.

	Then we specifically tested memory in a variety of ways, since memory was not used at all in the normal example.
		For example, we changed different index values in the memory to make sure it worked out.
		We checked the bounds and made sure the error messages printed as expected.
		We tried overwriting different memory addresses to make sure the new one would be stored and loaded correctly.

	Then we also tried to make sure any unused functions in the normal test case were used in ours, and executed correctly.
